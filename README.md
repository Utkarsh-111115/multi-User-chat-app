Simple Interface: The interface is straightforward, making it easy for users to chat without complications.

Server Logging: The server logs important events such as user connections, disconnections, and messages.

Technologies Used:

Java: The core programming language used for both the client and server-side implementation.Advanced java concepts like Java Swings and Java AWT are used.

Socket Programming: Socket API is utilized for communication between the client and server.

Thread Handling: Threads are employed to handle multiple client connections concurrently.

Logging: Java's built-in logging framework is used for server-side logging.
